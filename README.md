# dog_causal_perception
Analysis of an eye-tracking experiment with dogs (N=14) on causal perception (launching events with and without contact). 

## causal_perception_dwell_time_analysis:
* Area of interest analysis dwell time analysis

## causal_perception_pupil_size_analysis:
* Preprocessing of pupil size data (following the recommendations by van Rij et al., 2019, https://doi.org/10.1177/2331216519832483)
* Analysis of pupil size data using GAMMs (following the recommendations by van Rij et al., 2019, https://doi.org/10.1177/2331216519832483)
* Analysis of aggregated pupil size data using GLMMs
* Analysis of dogs' motion tracking (i.e. how well their horizontal gaze coordinates were explained by the horizontal coordinates of the moving balls)
* R script underlying Figure 1
